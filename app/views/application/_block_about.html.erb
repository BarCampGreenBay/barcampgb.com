      <p>This free event is entirely produced by <strong>you</strong>, the participants, so chances are if you are an attendee you are also a speaker. The topics tend to be somewhat tech-focused, but anyone and everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend and present on whatever they find fascinating.</p>

          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <p>A typical BarCamp starts off with participant collaboration on the session grid, which is broken up into 45-minute blocks. Propose a talk, discussion, demo, workshop… whatever works for you!</p>

          <h3>Give a talk? Really?</h3>
          <p>Hey, if presenting isn’t your thing, that's cool. We understand, but we ask that you find another way to contribute, like helping with set-up or keeping the conference area tidy.</p>
